### Development tips

Additional dev dependencies can be installed with

```sh
pip install black isort pyqt5-tools
```

To run from the repository, e.g., for testing changes, run `make`.
To rebuild the UI after editing `mainwindow.ui` in Qt Designer, run `make ui`.
Note this will change the `mainwindow.py` module, which will need to be
committed to the repo.
